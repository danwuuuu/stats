Engineering measurement and analysis are critical to any engineering practice. The collection and interpretation of data allow us to characterize engineering processes and products, evaluate the progress relative to plan, predict outcomes by understanding relationships between different factors, and improve results. For instance, semiconductor engineers may wish to determine how different dosages for wafer implant materials affect wafer resistivity. Aerospace engineers may wish to examine how different fuel blends affect engine efficiencies. Biomedical engineers researching medical technologies may wish to determine the optimal stimulation power to apply in advanced imaging systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


Introduction: 
This project analyzes the data of different students' GPA in order to show how GPA is influenced by student's in class attendance.
There are other factors, such as students' interests, exam method, and professors can also influence student's GPA. The group decides this topic because lecture attendance is considered as the main factor in students' GPA. In the investigation, the group aims at finding out the relationship of this phenomenon from the statistical analysis. Ultimately, this project is going to demonstrate that the GPA may be or not affected by how students perform.
